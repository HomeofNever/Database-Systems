Why Vimeo?
------------

Some of you may be asking why I chose to put my videos on Vimeo, while
in the past, I have used YouTube.

In many ways, YouTube is a good technology and may be better than
Vimeo.  However, YouTube uses ads and watch time to generate
revenue. As a result, it has an incentive to find and recommend videos
that will not only get clicks but will be watched for a long time. As
a result, YouTube is not free. We pay for it with our attention.

Vimeo on the other hand charges me, content producer, to upload
videos. It does not have algorithmic recommendation and does not
generate revenue (as far as I know) by monetizing your attention.

This is not a judgment or criticism of anyone who uses YouTube for
their work or entertainment. I watch things on YouTube all the
time. However, I do not want to contribute to you spending more time
on it with my course content. This is my personal choice. I have come
to my decision through my research and related reading on algorithmic
bias and ethical technology.

YouTube monetizes attention, what gets attention gets recommended by
the algorithms. We are attracted to novel and unusual content. Is this
inherently bad? Not really. If I watch a Sea Otter video, YouTube will
find other Sea Otter videos or other animal videos that I might
like. May be a hummingbird who is snoring or a Sea Otter giving
birth. All unusual but cute.

But sometimes, this goes in a darker direction. You watch a video
about a scientific concept, but YouTube recommends you a video about a
crazy conspiracy theory on a related topic. YouTube has found that
people who believe in conspiracy theories tend to watch videos for a
long time. So YouTube's algorithms are happy recommend these
excessively, orders of magnitude more. If you watched anything
slightly political, you may be caught in a loop of more and more
extreme content recommended to you, because well, they are more
attention gathering. We all know that users might be exposed to a lot
of content that may bother them. I support the maxim that "free speech
is not equal to free reach." My main concern is that YouTube chooses
to value such content more than others and I have no say on what my
values are. I cannot choose the type of content I do not want to
see. This is a system implementation decision on YouTube's part. While
YouTube has taken some steps to improve this, there is still a long
way to go.

So, this is why we are on Vimeo. Even if it does not have some
features you are used to on YouTube, hopefully we can help improve it
by using it more. If you want to learn more about this topic, you can
