It also featured animations by Terry Gilliam  often sequenced or merged with live action. The first episode was recorded on 7 September and broadcast on 5 October 1969 on BBC One  with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974  plus two episodes for German TV.The show often targets the idiosyncrasies of British life  especially that of professionals  and is at times politically charged. The members of Monty Python were highly educated. Terry Jones and Michael Palin are Oxford University graduates; Eric Idle  John Cleese  and Graham Chapman attended Cambridge University; and American-born member Terry Gilliam is an Occidental College graduate. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual  with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures. The series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series Q5  rather than the traditional sketch show format. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise  and succeeded so completely that the adjective ''''Pythonesque'''' was invented to define it and  later  similar material.Monty Python''''s Flying Circus featuring Eric Idle and Connie Booth has one or more episodes streaming with subscription on Netflix  and available for purchase on iTunes.
